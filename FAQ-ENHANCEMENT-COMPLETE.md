## Technical Implementation:

### State Management:

const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState<CategoryType>('All');
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
```

### Filtering Logic:
```typescript
const filteredFAQs = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = faqs;

  // Filter by category
  if (selectedCategory !== 'All') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(faq => faq.category === selectedCategory);
  }

  // Filter by search
  if (searchQuery.trim()) {
    const query = searchQuery.toLowerCase();
    filtered = filtered.filter(faq =>
      faq.question.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
      faq.answer.toLowerCase().includes(query)
    );
  }

  return filtered;
}, [selectedCategory, searchQuery]);
```

### Data Structure:
```typescript
interface FAQItem {
  question: string;
  answer: string;
  category: string;
}
```
