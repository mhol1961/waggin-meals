**Priority:** High - Potential product offering for GHL users
**Created:** 2025-01-24

## üéØ Business Opportunity

### The Market Gap:
- **GoHighLevel (GHL)** native e-commerce is reportedly subpar
- Many GHL users need better e-commerce solutions
- This system integrates WITH GHL for CRM/marketing but provides superior e-commerce

### Revenue Potential:
1. **Template Sales** - Sell as one-time purchase ($500-2,000)
2. **Setup Service** - Charge for installation/customization ($1,500-5,000)
3. **Monthly SaaS** - Host for clients ($99-299/month)
4. **White Label** - License to agencies ($5,000-15,000/year)

### Target Market:
- GHL users selling physical products
- GHL agencies serving e-commerce clients
- Small businesses migrating from Shopify (like Christie!)
- Subscription box companies
- Direct-to-consumer brands

---
