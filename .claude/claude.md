# 🚨🚨🚨 READ THIS FIRST - DO NOT FORGET 🚨🚨🚨

## 🛑🛑🛑 CRITICAL GIT COMMIT RULES 🛑🛑🛑

### ❌ NEVER COMMIT TO GIT WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION ❌

**ABSOLUTE RULES:**
1. **DO NOT run `git commit` unless the user explicitly tells you to commit**
2. **DO NOT run `git push` unless the user explicitly tells you to push**
3. **ALWAYS verify builds work locally BEFORE committing** (`npm run build` must succeed)
4. **User is near Netlify build limit** - every commit triggers a build and costs money
5. **Builds often fail first time** - must test locally to avoid wasting builds
6. **WAIT for user approval** even if changes look perfect

**CORRECT WORKFLOW:**
1. Make code changes
2. Run `npm run build` locally to verify
3. Fix any errors
4. Run `npm run build` again until it passes
5. **WAIT for user to say "commit this"**
6. Only then: `git add` and `git commit`
7. **WAIT for user to say "push this"**
8. Only then: `git push`

**If you commit without permission, you waste Netlify builds and cost money.**

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ THIS IS A COMPLETE, STANDALONE E-COMMERCE WEBSITE ⚠️⚠️⚠️

### ABSOLUTE RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE:

1. **THIS IS A MIGRATION FROM SHOPIFY TO A COMPLETE NEW E-COMMERCE PLATFORM**
2. **WE ARE MIGRATING ALL CUSTOMERS, SUBSCRIBERS, PRODUCTS, AND DATA FROM SHOPIFY**
3. **CHRISTIE HATES SHOPIFY - WE'RE MOVING EVERYTHING TO THIS NEW SYSTEM**
4. **THIS NEW SYSTEM MUST HAVE EVERY E-COMMERCE FEATURE SHOPIFY HAD**
5. **AFTER MIGRATION IS COMPLETE, SHOPIFY WILL BE SHUT DOWN FOREVER**
6. **NEVER SUGGEST KEEPING SHOPIFY OR USING IT ALONGSIDE THIS SYSTEM**

**We're migrating FROM Shopify TO this new complete e-commerce platform.**
**After all customers/subscribers are migrated, Shopify gets shut down and never used again.**

---

## ⚠️ THIS IS A COMPLETE SHOPIFY REPLACEMENT - NOT A MIGRATION

**CHRISTIE HATES SHOPIFY AND WILL NEVER USE IT FOR E-COMMERCE.**

This is a **BRAND NEW, STANDALONE E-COMMERCE WEBSITE** that must have:
- ✅ **ALL e-commerce features** (product management, orders, customers, inventory)
- ✅ **FULL subscription management** (recurring billing, auto-charge, failed payments)
- ✅ **COMPLETE admin dashboard** (manage everything - products, orders, customers, subscriptions)
- ✅ **ALL payment processing** (Authorize.net with CIM for tokenization)
- ✅ **Marketing automation** (GoHighLevel for CRM, email, SMS, abandoned cart)
- ✅ **Customer portal** (self-service subscription management)
- ✅ **Everything Shopify does but BETTER and under Christie's control**

**The Shopify exports were to MIGRATE AWAY from Shopify, NOT to keep using it.**

**NEVER suggest keeping Shopify or using it alongside this system. This system IS the complete replacement.**

## Remember:

**THIS IS NOT A SHOPIFY SUPPLEMENT. THIS IS A SHOPIFY REPLACEMENT.**

When Christie asks for e-commerce features, she needs FULL features - not "keep Shopify for that."

Build it right. Build it complete. Build it better than Shopify.
