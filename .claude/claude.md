## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS A COMPLETE, STANDALONE E-COMMERCE WEBSITE ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

### ABSOLUTE RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE:

1. **THIS IS A MIGRATION FROM SHOPIFY TO A COMPLETE NEW E-COMMERCE PLATFORM**
2. **WE ARE MIGRATING ALL CUSTOMERS, SUBSCRIBERS, PRODUCTS, AND DATA FROM SHOPIFY**
3. **CHRISTIE HATES SHOPIFY - WE'RE MOVING EVERYTHING TO THIS NEW SYSTEM**
4. **THIS NEW SYSTEM MUST HAVE EVERY E-COMMERCE FEATURE SHOPIFY HAD**
5. **AFTER MIGRATION IS COMPLETE, SHOPIFY WILL BE SHUT DOWN FOREVER**
6. **NEVER SUGGEST KEEPING SHOPIFY OR USING IT ALONGSIDE THIS SYSTEM**

**We're migrating FROM Shopify TO this new complete e-commerce platform.**
**After all customers/subscribers are migrated, Shopify gets shut down and never used again.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS A COMPLETE SHOPIFY REPLACEMENT - NOT A MIGRATION

**CHRISTIE HATES SHOPIFY AND WILL NEVER USE IT FOR E-COMMERCE.**

This is a **BRAND NEW, STANDALONE E-COMMERCE WEBSITE** that must have:
- ‚úÖ **ALL e-commerce features** (product management, orders, customers, inventory)
- ‚úÖ **FULL subscription management** (recurring billing, auto-charge, failed payments)
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE admin dashboard** (manage everything - products, orders, customers, subscriptions)
- ‚úÖ **ALL payment processing** (Authorize.net with CIM for tokenization)
- ‚úÖ **Marketing automation** (GoHighLevel for CRM, email, SMS, abandoned cart)
- ‚úÖ **Customer portal** (self-service subscription management)
- ‚úÖ **Everything Shopify does but BETTER and under Christie's control**

**The Shopify exports were to MIGRATE AWAY from Shopify, NOT to keep using it.**

**NEVER suggest keeping Shopify or using it alongside this system. This system IS the complete replacement.**

## Remember:

**THIS IS NOT A SHOPIFY SUPPLEMENT. THIS IS A SHOPIFY REPLACEMENT.**

When Christie asks for e-commerce features, she needs FULL features - not "keep Shopify for that."

Build it right. Build it complete. Build it better than Shopify.
