## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Payment Integration

**Primary Processor: Authorize.net**
To complete the Authorize.net integration:
1. Set up Authorize.net merchant account
2. Obtain API credentials:
   - API Login ID
   - Transaction Key
3. Add to `.env.local` (see Environment Variables section below)
4. Implement Authorize.net Accept.js in `/app/checkout/page.tsx`
5. Test in sandbox mode first
6. Switch to production when ready

**Backup Processor: QuickBooks**
To set up QuickBooks as backup:
1. Set up QuickBooks Payments account
2. Obtain API credentials (Client ID, Secret)
3. Implement fallback logic in checkout
4. Test backup flow

**Additional Steps:**
5. Add order confirmation emails
6. Create order history in database
7. Add invoice generation

### Database Migration
Currently products use static data (`/data/products.ts`). To migrate:
1. Run product seed script to populate Supabase
2. Update `/app/shop/page.tsx` to fetch from database
3. Update `/app/products/[handle]/page.tsx` to fetch from database
4. Products can be managed via `/admin/products`

### Additional Features to Consider
