# ‚úÖ Product Variants & Shipping Calculator - COMPLETE

## üéâ What Was Built:

### Part 1: Product Variants System

#### ‚úÖ 1. Type System & Data Structure (`/types/product.ts`)

**Created comprehensive variant types:**
```typescript
interface ProductVariant {
  id: string;
  sku: string;
  title: string; // e.g., "4-Cup Pack", "12-Cup Pack"
  price: number;
  compareAtPrice?: number; // Show savings
  weight: string;
  servings: number;
  inStock: boolean;
  stockQty: number;
  isDefault?: boolean; // Which variant to show by default
}
```

**Features:**
- Full variant support with individual pricing
- Stock tracking per variant
- Savings calculations (compare-at pricing)
- Default variant selection
- Helper functions for display and calculations

---

#### ‚úÖ 2. Beautiful Variant Selector Component (`/components/product-variant-selector.tsx`)

**What it does:**
- Displays all available product sizes/variants
- Shows pricing with savings percentages
- Price-per-cup calculations
- Stock status for each variant
- "Best Value" badges
- Selected variant summary
- Mobile-responsive design

**Visual Features:**
- Radio button selection
- Color-coded selection (blue highlight)
- Stock warnings ("Only X left!")
- Out of stock variants (grayed out, disabled)
- Savings badges ("Save 15%!")
- Per-cup pricing display

---

#### ‚úÖ 3. Example Product with Variants

**Chicken & Sweet Potato now has 3 size options:**

| Size | Servings | Price | Save | Per Cup |
|------|----------|-------|------|---------|
| **4-Cup Pack** | 4 cups (800g) | $15.99 | - | $4.00/cup |
| **8-Cup Pack** | 8 cups (1.6kg) | $28.78 | 10% | $3.60/cup |
| **12-Cup Pack** | 12 cups (2.4kg) | $40.77 | 15% | $3.40/cup |

**This incentivizes larger purchases while giving customers flexibility!**

---

#### ‚úÖ 4. Product Page Integration

**Updated `/app/products/[handle]/page.tsx` to:**
- Import and use ProductVariantSelector component
- Track selected variant in state
- Update price display based on variant selection
- Show variant selector between description and tags
- Handle products with and without variants

**Features:**
- Price updates when variant is selected
- Variant-specific stock status
- Savings displayed prominently

```

## üîß Technical Details:

### Weight Parsing:
Supports multiple formats:

- Ounces: "16 oz" ‚Üí 1 lb
- Pounds: "2.5 lb" ‚Üí 2.5 lbs

### Shipping Calculation:
```
Base Rate + (Weight in lbs √ó Per-Pound Rate) = Shipping Cost

Example (Zone 1, 3.5 lbs):
$9.99 + (3.5 √ó $0.50) = $11.74
```
