# Complete Summary - Where We Are & What's Next

## Quick Answer to Your Questions

### 1. What do you need me to provide?
**See**: `WHAT-YOU-NEED-TO-PROVIDE.md`

**TL;DR**:
- Authorize.net credentials (3 items)
- GHL webhook URLs (2 URLs - after snapshot imported)
- Resend API key (1 item)

**You can take your time gathering these - I'll keep building!**

---

### 2. What do I give my AI assistant for GHL snapshot?
**Give them**: `FOR-AI-ASSISTANT-GHL-SNAPSHOT.md`

**Instructions**:
1. Copy that file
2. Paste into your AI assistant
3. Also give them: `GHL-SNAPSHOT-SPECIFICATION.md`
4. They'll generate the snapshot
5. Import snapshot to GHL
6. Get the 2 webhook URLs
7. Give URLs to me

---

### 3. What webhook info do I need from GHL?

**After importing the snapshot**, you need **2 webhook URLs**:

1. **Payment Updated Webhook**
   - Go to GHL → Workflows → "Subscription Payment Updated"
   - Copy webhook URL from trigger

2. **Payment Failed Webhook**
   - Go to GHL → Workflows → "Subscription Payment Failed"
   - Copy webhook URL from trigger

That's it! Just 2 URLs.

### 4. What do you need to work on next?

**See**: `WHATS-NEXT-TO-BUILD.md`

**Priority 1**: Customer Login + Dashboard
- Customers can log in
- View order history
- Manage addresses
- Update profile

**Estimate**: 10-12 hours

**Priority 2**: Product Admin UI (optional)
- Christie can add/edit products herself
- No need for Supabase dashboard

**Estimate**: 6-8 hours

---

### 5. Can you continue building while I gather info?

**YES! ABSOLUTELY!**

Here's how it works:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│             RIGHT NOW (TODAY)                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ YOU: Start gathering credentials            │
│ ME:  Build customer login + dashboard       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          TOMORROW / THIS WEEK               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ YOU: Continue gathering at your pace        │
│ ME:  Finish login, build product admin      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       WHEN YOU GET CREDENTIALS              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ YOU: Paste credentials in chat              │
│ ME:  Update .env.local (5 minutes)          │
│ BOTH: Test everything (1-2 hours)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              GO LIVE!                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ - Run migration scripts                     │
│ - Launch re-authorization campaign          │
│ - Christie's site is live!                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**No waiting needed - we work in parallel!**

### 6. Can you build everything and I just plug in credentials later?

**YES! That's exactly the plan!**

**How it works**:

I'll build using **placeholder values** like:
```bash
AUTHORIZENET_API_LOGIN_ID=test_login_id
AUTHORIZENET_TRANSACTION_KEY=test_transaction_key
GHL_WEBHOOK_PAYMENT_UPDATED=https://placeholder.com/webhook1
```

When you get the real credentials:
```bash
AUTHORIZENET_API_LOGIN_ID=5KP3u95bQpv  ← Your real value
AUTHORIZENET_TRANSACTION_KEY=346HZ32z3fP4hT  ← Your real value
GHL_WEBHOOK_PAYMENT_UPDATED=https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/hooks/abc123  ← Your real value
```

Just replace the values in `.env.local` and everything works!

**Takes 5 minutes to update. That's it!**

### 7. What about OAuth login and customer accounts?

**Current Status**: ❌ Not built yet

**What IS built**:
- ✅ Admin login (Christie can log in to admin panel)
- ✅ Subscription portal (secure token access, no password needed)

**What's NOT built**:
- ❌ Customer login/registration
- ❌ Customer dashboard (order history, addresses)
- ❌ OAuth (Google/Facebook login)

**What I recommend building next**:
1. **Magic Link Login** (easiest for customers)
   - Customer enters email
   - Gets login link via email
   - Clicks link → logged in
   - No password to remember!

2. **Customer Dashboard**
   - View order history
   - Manage addresses
   - Update profile
   - Link to subscription portal (if subscriber)

**This will take 10-12 hours** and give you a complete e-commerce site.

**Should I build this now?** (Say YES or NO)

### Question 3: Should I build Product Admin UI?
