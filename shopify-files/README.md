## What to Export from Shopify:

1. **Products**
   - Go to: Products → More actions → Export
   - Download CSV with all product data

2. **Theme**
   - Go to: Online Store → Themes
   - Click "Actions" → "Download theme file"
   - Upload the .zip file here

3. **Customer Data** (for migration)
   - Customers → Export customers
   - This will help migrate your 300+ customers

## Why We Need This:

Since you DON'T want to continue using Shopify, we need these files to:
- Understand your current product catalog
- Migrate products to the new Next.js site
- Build a custom e-commerce solution
- Preserve product images and descriptions
- Maintain SEO for product pages
