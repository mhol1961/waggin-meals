duck-bars-2,Duck Bars - Natural Dog Treat,"<p>Your dog will be pawing for more with these Duck Bars. These are all natural, limited ingredient dog treats made in the USA.  Our Bars are a great  source of protein and full of flavor your dog will love. They are similar in texture to jerky treats and are low in fat.</p>
<p> Ingredients:</p>
<p>Duck: <span>Duck meat is full of essential nutrients, and it is a great alternative dog food for pets with food allergies to other protein sources like chicken.</span></p>
<p>Pea Flour:<span> </span><b>Pea flour is a good source of plant-based protein for dogs</b><span>. It is also a good source of fiber, which can aid in digestion.</span></p>
<p>Chickpea: <span>They are a great source of protein, potassium, magnesium, and folate as well as vitamins A, B, and C.</span></p>
<p>Coconut Glycerin:</p>
<p>Coconut glycerin is a healthy, natural part of animal fats and vegetable oils. Produced from coconut oil, glycerin can potentially increase your dog's lifespan, increase their endurance, improve hydration and help their eyesight.</p>
<p>In fact, it may be the most underappreciated dietary supplement available. </p>
<p>Already in many of the natural foods we eat, coconut glycerin will not spike blood glucose or insulin—making it perfect for your dog's low carb diet.</p>
<p>Flaxseed: <b>Flaxseed is not only safe for dogs, but it contains several essential nutrients that your dog needs to stay healthy</b><span>. One of the most common reasons to give your dog flaxseed is to improve their skin and coat health. Flaxseed contains omega fatty acids and is especially high in the omega 6 fatty acid Linoleic Acid.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Duck, pea flour, pea protein, chickpea, coconut glycerin, potato flour, flaxseed,  cane molasses, salt, lactic acid, natural smoke flavor, mixed tocopherols ( a natural source of vitamin E)</p>
