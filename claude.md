## Site Assessment - January 2025

**Date**: January 26, 2025
**Assessment Type**: Security, SEO, and Performance Audit

### Summary
Comprehensive audit conducted across 87 pages, 33 components. Identified critical security issues, SEO gaps, and performance optimization opportunities.

### Critical Findings
- 🔴 Plain text credentials in `.env.local` (requires Netlify environment variable migration)
- 🔴 TypeScript and ESLint disabled in production builds
- 🟡 Missing essential SEO files (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, favicon)
- 🟡 899MB of unoptimized images
- 🟡 No page-specific metadata (all 87 pages share same title)

### Implementation Plan
Detailed findings, recommendations, and step-by-step implementation instructions:
**See**: `docs/SITE-ASSESSMENT-2025.md`

### Priority Fixes
1. **Security**: Migrate credentials to Netlify encrypted environment variables, remove build overrides, fix TypeScript errors
2. **SEO**: Create robots.txt, sitemap.xml, favicon; implement page-specific metadata and structured data
3. **Performance**: Manual image optimization (899MB → <200MB), enable compression, configure caching
4. **Code Quality**: Add error boundaries, loading states, centralize font definitions

### Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 11-16 hours over 3 days
- Security fixes: Day 1 (4-6 hours)
- SEO foundations: Day 1-2 (4-6 hours)
- Performance optimization: Day 2-3 (3-6 hours)
- Code quality: Day 2-3 (2-3 hours)

### Target Metrics
- Lighthouse Performance: 60 → 85+
- Image directory size: 899MB → <200MB
- TypeScript errors: Hidden → 0 errors enforced
- Pages with unique metadata: 0 → 87

  - Disabled inventory checking in `app/api/checkout/create-order/route.ts` (was causing 500 errors)
  - Reason: System returning "Unknown error" for all products
  - **TODO**: Re-enable once inventory system is fixed

**Database Schema Fixes** ✅
- **Orders Table (`app/api/checkout/create-order/route.ts`):**
  - Removed non-existent `notes` column (causing PGRST204 error)
  - Changed `transaction_id` → `payment_id` (matches schema)

  - Store full address + method in JSONB `shipping_address` column

- **Subscriptions Table (`app/api/checkout/create-subscription/route.ts`):**
  - Removed `variant_id` (doesn't exist in schema)
  - Removed `price` (schema uses `amount`)
  - Removed all shipping and customer fields (not in subscriptions schema)
  - Now matches `supabase/universal-migration.sql` exactly

**Error Handling & Diagnostics** ✅
- Enhanced error reporting in `app/api/checkout/create-order/route.ts:263-273`
- Shows Supabase error details (message, code, hint) for debugging
- Improved payment error display in `app/checkout/page.tsx:258-263`

- All marked as "Contains Secret Values"
- Scoped to: Builds, Functions, Runtime

**Current Status**
- ✅ Order creation working (creates orders in Supabase successfully)
