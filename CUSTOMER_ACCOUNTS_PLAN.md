## ðŸ”„ NEXT: Customer Account System

Customer accounts are a **much larger system** that requires:

### 1. Authentication & User Management

**What customers need:**
- Registration page (`/signup` or `/register`)
- Login page (`/login`)

- Profile management page

**Best approach: Use Supabase Auth**
- You already have Supabase configured
- Provides built-in authentication
- Handles email verification, password resets, OAuth
- Free tier includes 50,000 monthly active users
- Setup: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth

### 2. Customer Dashboard

**Pages needed:**
- `/account` or `/dashboard` - Main customer portal
- `/account/profile` - Edit profile, change password
- `/account/subscriptions` - Manage meal subscriptions
- `/account/orders` - Order history
- `/account/pets` - Manage pet profiles
- `/account/addresses` - Shipping addresses
- `/account/payment-methods` - Saved payment methods

### 3. Subscription Management

**Features customers need:**

**Integration required:**

## Quick Start Option: Use Existing Solutions

**Fastest path to launch:**

1. **Use Shopify** for everything:
   - Products, checkout, customer accounts all built-in
   - Add subscription app (Recharge, Bold, etc.)
   - Embed Shopify customer portal on your site
   - Time: 1-2 days setup

2. **Use Stripe Customer Portal**:
   - Stripe creates a hosted portal
   - Customers manage subscriptions there
   - Your site just links to it
   - Time: 2-3 days setup

3. **Build custom (what we'd do)**:
   - Full control over design
   - Better integration with your brand
   - More flexibility
   - Time: 10-14 days

## Recommendation

**For Christie to review the site now:**
- âœ… Admin login is ready - she can test the CMS
- âœ… All public pages work
- âœ… Hero variations are ready to view

**For customer accounts:**
- **Short term:** Use Shopify or Stripe's hosted portals
- **Long term:** Build custom portal after getting customer feedback

Would you like me to:
1. Build the custom customer account system now?
2. Integrate with Shopify for quick launch?
3. Set up Stripe customer portal?
4. Just focus on other site features for now?
