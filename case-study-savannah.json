  "fullStory": "<div class=\"case-study-content\">\n<h2>Meet Savannah</h2>\n<p>Savannah is a delightful 13.5-year-old Miniature Schnauzer weighing 8.5 lbs. Her owner Margaret met Christie at Paige's and was intrigued by the personalized approach to canine nutrition that Waggin Meals offers—especially after hearing about the limitations of commercial pet food services.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding Miniature Schnauzer Health Needs</h2>\n<p>Miniature Schnauzers are prone to specific health concerns that require careful dietary management:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pancreatitis:</strong> Often triggered by high-fat diets, requiring lean protein sources</li>\n<li><strong>Hyperlipidemia:</strong> Elevated blood fats that need dietary control</li>\n<li><strong>Bladder Stones:</strong> Both genetic and dietary factors play a role</li>\n<li><strong>Diabetes Mellitus:</strong> Linked to obesity and genetic predisposition</li>\n<li><strong>Eye Issues:</strong> Including cataracts and Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Personalized Nutrition Plan</h2>\n<p>Christie developed a comprehensive nutrition plan specifically for Savannah's age, breed, and health profile:</p>\n\n<h3>Daily Nutrition Guidelines</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Estimated Daily Calories:</strong> 300-400</li>\n<li><strong>Serving Size:</strong> ⅓ cup per meal</li>\n<li><strong>Meals per Day:</strong> 2</li>\n<li><strong>Daily Total:</strong> 0.67 cups</li>\n<li><strong>30-Day Total:</strong> ~20 cups</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Base Diet Components</h3>\n<p>Fresh, gently cooked meals featuring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lean Proteins:</strong> Chicken, turkey, and beef</li>\n<li><strong>Complex Carbohydrates:</strong> For sustained energy</li>\n<li><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> Fish oil and coconut oil in controlled amounts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Nutritional Enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bone & Veggie Broth:</strong> 1 tablespoon per meal for hydration and joint support</li>\n<li><strong>Food Toppers:</strong> Chicken Super Food Cakes and Pup-a-Loaf</li>\n<li><strong>Freeze-Dried Superfood Toppers:</strong> Added nutrition and palatability</li>\n<li><strong>Seasonal Proteins:</strong> Venison and Alaskan Salmon for variety</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Product Details & Convenience</h2>\n<p>All meals and broth come in 4-cup BPA-free vacuum-sealed packs. Products arrive frozen and can be thawed and refrozen as needed. The bone broth is divided into 1-cup portions for easy storage and use.</p>\n\n<h3>Recommended Order</h3>\n<p>For Savannah's size and needs: 6 packs (1 extra for backup) + bone broth</p>\n\n<h2>Special Offer for Margaret</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Free shipping on first order</li>\n<li>Free Bone Broth with every order ($14.00 value)</li>\n<li>Ongoing shipping: $14.99 (reduced from $29.99)</li>\n<li>Orders over $165 qualify for free shipping</li>\n<li>Estimated monthly cost: ~$77.50 before tax & shipping</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Christie's Professional Approach</h2>\n<p><em>\"Our mission is to provide personalized plans that adapt as Savannah ages and her needs change. You'll always have direct access to myself and our team for guidance and support.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Unlike automated services or computer-generated responses, Waggin Meals offers truly personalized care. Christie takes the time to understand each dog's unique needs, breed-specific concerns, and owner's lifestyle to create nutrition plans that work.</p>\n\n<h2>The Waggin Meals Difference</h2>\n<p>At Waggin Meals, every bite matters. Meals are crafted in small batches to ensure quality and freshness. Ingredients are sourced from Waggin Meals' own garden when available, or from trusted farms that share their commitment to sustainability and nutrition.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't just about food—it's about joining a community that values personalized care and wellness for every dog.</p>\n\n<h2>Perfect for Senior Dogs</h2>\n<p>Savannah's case demonstrates the importance of breed- and age-specific nutrition planning. As dogs age, their nutritional needs change, and having access to an expert nutritionist who can adjust plans as needed is invaluable.</p>\n\n<p>The lean protein base helps prevent pancreatitis while maintaining muscle mass. The controlled portions prevent obesity-related complications. The fresh, whole-food ingredients provide maximum nutrient bioavailability—critical for senior dogs whose digestive systems may not process nutrients as efficiently as they once did.</p>\n</div>",

  "christieNotes": "Savannah's case exemplifies the importance of breed-specific nutrition planning, especially for senior Miniature Schnauzers prone to pancreatitis and hyperlipidemia. The custom plan features lean proteins to minimize fat intake while providing complete nutrition. At 13.5 years old, Savannah needs higher quality protein sources for muscle maintenance and carefully controlled portions to prevent weight gain. The inclusion of bone broth provides both hydration and joint support—essential for senior dogs. Regular monitoring and plan adjustments ensure the nutrition evolves with Savannah's changing needs.",
