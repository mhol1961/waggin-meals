## 🔧 How It Works

### Authentication Flow
```
1. Customer visits /login
2. Enters email address
3. Backend generates JWT token (expires 15min)
4. Email sent with magic link
5. Customer clicks link → /api/auth/verify?token=xxx
6. Token verified, session created (30 days)
7. Redirect to /customer/account
8. Session cookie stored (httpOnly, secure)
```

### Security Features
- ✅ JWT-based tokens with expiration
- ✅ HttpOnly cookies (can't be accessed by JavaScript)
- ✅ Secure cookies in production
- ✅ No passwords to leak or forget
- ✅ Tokens expire quickly (15 minutes)
- ✅ Sessions last 30 days

---

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Copy Environment File
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

### Step 2: Fill In Credentials (When You Get Them)

Open `.env.local` and update these values:

#### Authorize.net (Required for payments)
```bash
AUTHORIZENET_API_LOGIN_ID=your_actual_api_login_id
AUTHORIZENET_TRANSACTION_KEY=your_actual_transaction_key
AUTHORIZENET_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or 'production'
```

#### Resend (Required for magic link emails)
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=Waggin Meals <orders@wagginmeals.com>
```

#### GoHighLevel Webhooks (Required for subscription system)
```bash
GHL_WEBHOOK_PAYMENT_UPDATED=https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/hooks/abc123
GHL_WEBHOOK_PAYMENT_FAILED=https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/hooks/def456
```

#### Customer Auth Secret (Generate now!)
```bash
# Run this command:
openssl rand -base64 32

# Copy the output and paste it here:
CUSTOMER_JWT_SECRET=paste_generated_value_here
```

#### Cron Secret (Generate now!)
```bash
# Run this command:
openssl rand -hex 32

# Copy the output and paste it here:
CRON_SECRET=paste_generated_value_here
```

#### Base URL
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # For development
# Change to https://wagginmeals.com in production
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Locally

### 1. Generate secrets first:
```bash
# Generate customer JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate cron secret
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 2. Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
CUSTOMER_JWT_SECRET=your_generated_secret_here
CRON_SECRET=your_generated_cron_secret_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test the login flow:
```bash
# Visit:
http://localhost:3000/login

# Enter an email
# Check console logs for magic link (since Resend not configured yet)
# Copy the link from console and paste in browser
# Should redirect to /customer/account
```

### 5. Without Resend configured:
The magic link will be logged to the console like this:
```
Magic link for you@example.com : http://localhost:3000/api/auth/verify?token=xxxxx
```

Copy that URL and paste it in your browser to test!

---

## 📧 Email Configuration

### For Development (Console Logging)
- Magic links are logged to console
- No email service needed
- Perfect for testing

### For Production (Resend)
1. Sign up at https://resend.com
2. Get API key
3. Verify your domain
4. Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_abc123xyz
EMAIL_FROM=Waggin Meals <orders@wagginmeals.com>
```

Magic links will then be sent via real email!
