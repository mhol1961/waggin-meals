## ‚úÖ What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Generate GHL Snapshot (10 minutes)
1. Take the entire `GHL-SNAPSHOT-SPECIFICATIONS.md` file
2. Give it to your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
3. Ask it to: "Generate a complete GoHighLevel snapshot based on these specifications"
4. Import the snapshot into your GHL account

### Step 2: Collect Resources from GHL (15 minutes)
After importing snapshot, get:

**A. Webhook URLs** (3 needed):
- Go to Automations ‚Üí Workflows in GHL
- Open "First Purchase Thank You" workflow ‚Üí Copy webhook URL
- Open "Abandoned Cart Recovery" workflow ‚Üí Copy webhook URL
- Open "Order Shipped Notification" workflow ‚Üí Copy webhook URL

**B. Form Embed Codes** (3 needed):
- Go to Sites ‚Üí Forms in GHL
- Get embed code for "Newsletter Signup"
- Get embed code for "Contact Us"
- Get embed code for "Abandoned Cart Capture"

### Step 3: Share With Me
Send me:
```
GHL_WEBHOOK_NEW_ORDER=https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/hooks/xxxxx
GHL_WEBHOOK_CART_ABANDONED=https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/hooks/xxxxx
GHL_WEBHOOK_ORDER_SHIPPED=https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/hooks/xxxxx
```

Also let me know your preference for forms:
- [ ] Option A: Use GHL embedded forms (quick & easy)
- [ ] Option B: Keep custom forms, submit to GHL via API (more control)
- [ ] Option C: Hybrid approach (tell me which should be embedded vs custom)

### Step 4: I'll Build the Integration (1-2 hours)
Once I have your webhook URLs, I'll create:
- GHL service library
- Order webhook integration
- Abandoned cart tracking system
- Contact form GHL submission
- Form integrations (based on your preference)

### Step 5: Test Together (30 minutes)
We'll test:
- Newsletter signup ‚Üí GHL contact created ‚Üí Welcome email sent
- Contact form ‚Üí GHL contact created ‚Üí Auto-response sent
- Order placed ‚Üí GHL updated ‚Üí Thank you workflow triggered
- Cart abandoned ‚Üí GHL notified ‚Üí Recovery emails sent

## üìû Questions I Need Answered

### 1. Form Integration Preference?
**Embedded Forms (Easiest):**
- ‚úÖ Quick setup (just paste code)
- ‚úÖ GHL handles all validation
- ‚ùå Less control over styling
- ‚ùå May not match your exact design

**API Integration (More Control):**
- ‚úÖ Perfect design match
- ‚úÖ Full control over UX
- ‚úÖ Custom validation
- ‚ùå Takes slightly longer to build

**My Recommendation:** Embedded for Newsletter, API for Contact Form (since it's already custom)

### 2. Abandoned Cart Behavior?
- Should we show an email capture popup in the cart? (Common pattern)
- Or capture email subtly in the cart drawer? (Less intrusive)
- Time before marking abandoned: 30 minutes? 1 hour?

### 3. Existing Customer Data?
- Do you want to import existing Supabase customers into GHL?
- Or start fresh with new customers going forward?

### 4. Admin Notifications?
- Contact form submissions: Email, SMS, or both?
- New orders: Just GHL dashboard or notification too?
