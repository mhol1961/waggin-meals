## Recommended Priority Order

### Phase 1: Essential (Do This Week)
1. **Customer Login & Registration** (Option B - Magic Link) - 3-4 hours
2. **Customer Dashboard** (order history, addresses) - 6-8 hours

**Why**: Customers need to be able to log in and see their orders. This is expected e-commerce functionality.

### Phase 2: Important (Do Next Week)
3. **Product Admin UI** - 6-8 hours
4. **Order Tracking** - 2-3 hours

**Why**: Makes Christie's life easier managing products, and customers love tracking orders.

### Phase 3: Nice to Have (After Launch)
5. **Analytics Dashboard** - 5-6 hours
6. **Inventory Management** - 4-5 hours
7. **Product Reviews** - 4-5 hours

**Why**: These improve the business but aren't critical for launch.

---

## Total Time Estimates

### Minimum Viable (Phase 1):
- **10-12 hours** of development
- Gets you a fully functional e-commerce site

### Full-Featured (All Phases):
- **30-40 hours** total development
- Professional-grade e-commerce platform

---

## Can I Build While You Gather Info?

**YES!** I can build everything now and you can plug in credentials later.

### Here's How:

1. **I'll build Phase 1** (customer login + dashboard) - **RIGHT NOW**
2. **You gather credentials** (Authorize.net, GHL, etc.) - **YOUR PACE**
3. **When you provide credentials** - **5 MINUTES TO PLUG IN**
4. **We test in sandbox** - **1-2 HOURS**
5. **We go live!** - **READY!**

### What I'll Use for Testing:
- Placeholder values in `.env.local`
- Test mode for Authorize.net
- Mock data for testing

### What You'll Need to Do Later:
- Replace placeholder values with real credentials
- Just update `.env.local` file
- Done!

---

## What Should I Build Next?

### Option 1: I Build Phase 1 Now (Recommended)
**Customer login + dashboard** while you gather credentials.

**Result**: Complete e-commerce site ready for Christie to test.

### Option 2: I Build Product Admin Now
**Product management UI** so Christie can manage products herself.

**Result**: Christie-friendly admin for products.

### Option 3: I Build Everything
**All phases** - Full-featured platform.

**Result**: Professional-grade e-commerce with all bells and whistles.

---

## My Recommendation

**BUILD PHASE 1 NOW** (Customer Login + Dashboard)

**Why**:
1. It's expected e-commerce functionality
2. Takes 10-12 hours (doable in 1-2 days)
3. Makes the site feel complete
4. Customers can view order history
5. Better user experience

Then, after Christie sees it and loves it:
- Add Phase 2 features if she wants them
- Get paid for additional features
- Build your portfolio

## About OAuth Login

**Current Status**: ‚ùå Not built yet

**Should we add it?**

**My recommendation**: Start with **Magic Link** (email-based login)
- No password to remember
- More secure than password
- Faster to implement
- Can add OAuth later if needed

**If you want OAuth** (Google/Facebook login):
- Takes longer (5-7 hours)
- Requires OAuth app setup
- More complex
- But looks modern/professional

**Your call!** Tell me which you prefer and I'll build it.

---

## What Do You Want Me to Do Next?

Please tell me:

1. **Should I build Customer Login + Dashboard now?** (YES/NO)
2. **Which login type?** (Magic Link / Email+Password / OAuth)
3. **Should I build Product Admin too?** (YES/NO)
4. **Or should I wait for credentials first?** (WAIT/BUILD)

Once you tell me, I'll start building immediately! üöÄ
