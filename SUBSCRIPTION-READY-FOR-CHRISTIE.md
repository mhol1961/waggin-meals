## What I Need From You (CRITICAL)

### 1. Current Subscriber Data
Please share whatever data you have about your 100 subscribers:

**Required (Must Have):**
- Email addresses
- First and last names
- What they're subscribed to (products)
- How much they pay
- How often they're billed (weekly/monthly?)
- When is their next billing date?

**Optional (But Helpful):**
- Phone numbers (for SMS backup)
- Dog names (for personalization)
- Dog breed/age
- Any special notes

**Format:** Excel, Google Sheet, CSV, or even just a list - I can work with anything!

### 2. Authorize.net Information

**Do you have:**
- Authorize.net account set up? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- Customer Information Manager (CIM) enabled? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- API Login ID and Transaction Key? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- Are you currently using sandbox or production? ___________

**Important:** CIM is required for storing payment tokens securely. If not enabled, we need to enable it in your Authorize.net account (takes 1 day).

### 3. Timeline Questions

**Critical dates:**
- When do you want to start the re-authorization campaign? ___________
- What's the earliest someone's subscription renews? ___________
- Do you want 14-day deadline or different? ___________
- Any upcoming billing dates we need to work around? ___________

### 4. Subscription Details

**Help me understand:**
- Are all subscriptions monthly? Or do you have weekly/bi-weekly too?
- Is everyone on the same pricing or custom amounts?
- Same products for everyone or custom boxes?
- Do people all bill on same day (like 1st of month) or different days?

### 5. Customer Communication Preferences

**From you or from "team"?**
- Should re-auth emails come from "Christie" or "Waggin' Meals Team"?
- Do you want to personally call high-value subscribers ($100+/month)?
- What's your support phone number for the emails?

## The System I'll Build

Once you provide the above info, I'll build:

### Phase 1: Customer Portal (4-6 hours)
**URL:** `https://wagginmeals.com/account/[secure-token]`

**Features:**
- Customer enters their unique secure link (from email)
- Sees their current subscription details
- Updates payment method securely (Authorize.net iframe - PCI compliant)
- Confirmation message
- Webhook to GHL notifying payment updated

**Security:**
- Unique token per customer
- No password needed (reduces friction)
- Payment data never touches our server
- Authorize.net handles all card processing

### Phase 2: Token Generation & Import (2-3 hours)
- I generate unique secure tokens for each of your 100 subscribers
- Add tokens to your subscriber data
- You import into GHL using the CSV
- Tokens get added to GHL custom fields
- Re-auth workflow triggered when you tag them

### Phase 3: Recurring Billing Automation (4-5 hours)
- Daily cron job runs at 2 AM
- Checks which subscriptions bill today
- Charges their stored payment token
- If successful: Creates order, sends confirmation, updates GHL
- If failed: Retry logic (3 attempts over 10 days)
- After 3 failures: Pause subscription + notify customer

### Phase 4: GHL Integration (2-3 hours)
- Webhook when payment updated ‚Üí GHL tags "Payment Updated"
- Webhook when payment fails ‚Üí GHL tags "Payment Failed"
- Webhook when subscription paused ‚Üí GHL updates status
- All events update customer timeline in GHL

### Phase 5: Admin Dashboard (3-4 hours)
- View all subscriptions at `/admin/subscriptions`
- See active/paused/cancelled status
- Monitor upcoming billing dates
- View failed payments
- Export subscriber lists
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) tracking

**Total Build Time:** 15-20 hours of focused work

## Questions?

I know this is a lot! But it's all designed to make this migration smooth and successful.

**What I need most right now:**
1. Your subscriber data (even if incomplete)
