# Subscription Billing System - Implementation Summary

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS DOCUMENT IS SUPERSEDED - SEE `SUBSCRIPTION-SYSTEM-STATUS.md` FOR CURRENT STATUS**

**Original Status:** Backend Complete ‚úÖ
**Date:** January 2025
**Update:** Critical bugs found and fixed - see STATUS document for accurate information

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema ‚úÖ
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250128_create_subscriptions.sql`

**Tables created:**
- `subscriptions` - Core subscription records with billing schedule
- `payment_methods` - Tokenized payment profiles from Authorize.net
- `subscription_invoices` - Individual billing attempts with retry tracking
- `subscription_history` - Complete audit trail

**Key features:**
- JSONB items field for flexible product storage
- Billing frequency support (weekly, biweekly, monthly, 4/6/8 weeks)
- Status tracking (active, paused, cancelled, past_due, expired)
- Automatic timestamps and audit fields

---

### 2. TypeScript Types ‚úÖ
**File:** `types/subscription.ts` (235 lines)

**Defined types for:**
- Subscription entities
- Payment methods
- Invoices and invoice items
- API request/response structures
- Authorize.net CIM responses

---

### 3. Authorize.net Integration ‚úÖ
**File:** `lib/authorize-net.ts` (330 lines)

**Functions:**
- `createCustomerProfile()` - Tokenize cards via CIM
- `addPaymentProfile()` - Add cards to existing customers
- `chargeCustomerProfile()` - Process payments
- `deletePaymentProfile()` - Remove cards
- `refundTransaction()` - Process refunds
- `isConfigured()` - Environment check

**Security:** PCI compliant - no raw card data stored, only tokens

---

### 4. Subscription API Routes ‚úÖ

**Created 9 API endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/subscriptions` | GET | List customer subscriptions |
| `/api/subscriptions` | POST | Create new subscription |
| `/api/subscriptions/[id]` | GET | Get single subscription |
| `/api/subscriptions/[id]` | PATCH | Update subscription |
| `/api/subscriptions/[id]` | DELETE | Cancel subscription |
| `/api/subscriptions/[id]/pause` | POST | Pause subscription |
| `/api/subscriptions/[id]/resume` | POST | Resume subscription |
| `/api/payment-methods` | GET/POST | List/add payment methods |
| `/api/payment-methods/[id]` | DELETE/PATCH | Remove/update payment method |

**Features:**
- Soft deletes for audit compliance
- Default payment method system
- Prevents deletion of payment methods used by active subscriptions
- Customer profile reuse (don't create duplicate Authorize.net profiles)

---

### 5. Recurring Billing Automation ‚úÖ
**File:** `app/api/cron/process-billing/route.ts` (310+ lines)

**What it does:**
- Runs daily to find subscriptions due for billing
- Charges payment methods via Authorize.net
- Creates order and invoice records
- Handles payment failures with retry logic
- Marks subscriptions as past_due after 3 failures
- Logs all events to subscription_history

**Retry logic:**
- Attempt 1: Retry in 3 days
- Attempt 2: Retry in 5 days
- Attempt 3+: Retry in 7 days, then mark past_due

**Security:** Protected with `CRON_SECRET` environment variable

---

### 6. GoHighLevel Integration ‚úÖ
**File:** `lib/ghl-service.ts` (300+ lines)

**Webhook events sent to GHL:**
1. `subscription.created` - Welcome new subscriber
2. `subscription.payment.success` - Payment confirmation
3. `subscription.payment.failed` - Alert to update payment
4. `subscription.paused` - Pause confirmation
5. `subscription.resumed` - Welcome back
6. `subscription.cancelled` - Goodbye and feedback

**Each webhook includes:**
- Customer info (name, email, phone)
- Subscription details (frequency, amount, items, next billing date)
- Payment info (invoice number, transaction ID, attempt count)
- Metadata (pause reason, cancellation reason)

**Integration points:**
- Subscription creation (POST /api/subscriptions)
- Subscription cancellation (DELETE /api/subscriptions/[id])
- Subscription pause (POST /api/subscriptions/[id]/pause)
- Subscription resume (POST /api/subscriptions/[id]/resume)
- Payment success (cron job)
- Payment failure (cron job)

---

### 7. GHL Snapshot Documentation ‚úÖ
**File:** `docs/GHL-SNAPSHOT-SETUP.md`

**Contents:**
- Complete webhook event structures (all 6 types)
- Example JSON payloads for each event
- GHL workflow setup instructions
- Email template examples
- Merge field reference
- Testing guide with cURL commands
- Prompt for AI assistant to create workflows

## Environment Variables Needed

Add these to `.env.local`:

```env
# Authorize.net (Payment Processing)
AUTHORIZENET_API_LOGIN_ID=your_api_login_id
AUTHORIZENET_TRANSACTION_KEY=your_transaction_key
AUTHORIZENET_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or "production"

# GoHighLevel (Customer Communication)
GHL_WEBHOOK_URL=your_ghl_webhook_url
GHL_API_KEY=your_ghl_api_key  # Optional

# Cron Job Security
CRON_SECRET=generate_a_random_secret_here

# Already configured:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
# RESEND_API_KEY
```

---

## How to Deploy

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Apply the subscription tables to Supabase
# In Supabase dashboard: SQL Editor ‚Üí Run the migration file
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
- Add all environment variables to Netlify or Vercel
- Never commit `.env.local` to git

### 3. Configure Cron Job
**Option A: Netlify Scheduled Functions**
```toml
# netlify.toml
[[functions]]
  name = "process-billing"
  schedule = "0 2 * * *"  # Run daily at 2 AM
```

**Option B: External Cron Service**
- Use cron-job.org or EasyCron
- Schedule daily POST to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/cron/process-billing`
- Add header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET`

### 4. Set Up GoHighLevel Workflows
- Follow instructions in `docs/GHL-SNAPSHOT-SETUP.md`
- Use the provided prompt with your GHL AI assistant
- Test each webhook event type

### 5. Test the System
1. Create test subscription via API
2. Verify webhook sent to GHL
3. Check GHL workflow triggered
4. Verify email sent
5. Test payment success/failure scenarios
