## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created

#### 1. `/lib/authorizenet-service.ts` (~400 lines)
Centralized payment processing service library.

**Exports:**
- `chargeStoredPaymentMethod()` - Charge using saved CIM payment profile
- `createCustomerProfile()` - Create customer in Authorize.net CIM
- `createPaymentProfile()` - Save credit card to CIM
- `testConnection()` - Verify API credentials
- `isConfigured()` - Check if credentials are set

**Key Features:**
- Environment-aware API endpoints (sandbox/production)
- Comprehensive error handling and response parsing
- TypeScript interfaces for API requests/responses (no `any` types)
- Throws errors when credentials missing (calling code handles fallback)
- Detailed logging for debugging

**Important Note:** The service itself **throws errors** when Authorize.net credentials are not configured. The graceful fallback to simulated payments happens in the **calling API routes** (checkout endpoints and cron jobs), not in the service library itself.

**API Reference:**
```typescript
// Charge a stored payment method
const response = await chargeStoredPaymentMethod({
  amount: 49.99,
  customerProfileId: '12345678',
  customerPaymentProfileId: '87654321',
  invoiceNumber: 'WM12345678',
  description: 'Order - 3 item(s)',
  customerId: 'customer-uuid',
  customerEmail: 'customer@example.com'
});
// Returns: { success: boolean, transactionId?: string, error?: string }

// Create customer profile in CIM
const profile = await createCustomerProfile({
  customerId: 'customer-uuid',
  email: 'customer@example.com',
  description: 'John Doe'
});
// Returns: { success: boolean, profileId?: string, error?: string }

// Create payment profile (save card)
const payment = await createPaymentProfile({
  customerProfileId: '12345678',
  cardNumber: '4111111111111111',
  expirationDate: '2025-12',
  cvv: '123',
  billingAddress: {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    address: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Austin',
    state: 'TX',
    zip: '78701',
    country: 'US'
  }
});
// Returns: { success: boolean, paymentProfileId?: string, error?: string }
```

## How It Works

### One-Time Order Payment Flow

```
User enters payment info
    ↓
Frontend: /api/checkout/create-order
    ↓
Backend checks if Authorize.net configured
    ↓
If new card:
  1. Get/create customer profile in CIM
  2. Create payment profile (tokenize card)
  3. Charge payment profile
  4. Save payment method to DB
    ↓
If saved card:
  1. Fetch payment method from DB
  2. Get CIM profile IDs
  3. Charge using CIM
    ↓
Success: Create order, deduct inventory, send email
Failure: Return error, no order created
```

### Subscription Creation Flow

```
User subscribes with payment info
    ↓
Frontend: /api/checkout/create-subscription
    ↓
REQUIRED: Authorize.net must be configured
    ↓
Create customer profile in CIM (if new)
    ↓
Create payment profile (tokenize card)
    ↓
Save payment method to DB with CIM IDs
    ↓
Create subscription record
    ↓
Charge initial payment
    ↓
Success: Active subscription + invoice
Failure: Subscription status = payment_failed
```

### Recurring Billing Flow

```
Daily cron: /api/cron/process-subscriptions
    ↓
Find subscriptions due for billing
    ↓
For each subscription:
  1. Create invoice record
  2. Fetch payment method with CIM IDs
  3. Charge using chargeStoredPaymentMethod()
  4. If success:
     - Mark invoice paid
     - Update next_billing_date
     - Create order for fulfillment
     - Deduct inventory
     - Send receipt email
  5. If failure:
     - Mark invoice failed
     - Set subscription to past_due
     - Send payment failed email
     - Schedule retry
```

### Failed Payment Retry Flow

```
Daily cron: /api/cron/retry-failed-payments
    ↓
Find failed invoices ready for retry
    ↓
For each invoice:
  1. Fetch payment method with CIM IDs
  2. Attempt charge
  3. If success:
     - Mark invoice paid
     - Reactivate subscription
     - Create order
     - Send success email
  4. If failure:
     - Increment attempt count
     - If max attempts reached:
       - Cancel subscription
       - Send cancellation email
     - Else:
       - Schedule next retry (exponential backoff)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (Development Mode)

**Without Authorize.net configured:**
- [ ] Create one-time order → Should use simulated payment
- [ ] Create subscription → Should fail with "not configured" error

**With Authorize.net configured (sandbox):**

**One-Time Orders:**
- [ ] Place order with new card → Card saved to CIM, payment processed
- [ ] Place order with saved card → Charge existing CIM payment profile
- [ ] Try with invalid card → Payment fails, order not created
- [ ] Check database: payment_methods has authorize_net IDs
- [ ] Check database: orders has transaction_id from Authorize.net

**Subscriptions:**
- [ ] Create subscription with new card → Card tokenized in CIM
- [ ] Initial payment charged successfully
- [ ] Check database: subscription created with payment_method_id
- [ ] Check database: payment_methods has CIM profile IDs
- [ ] Check database: subscription_invoices has transaction_id

**Recurring Billing:**
- [ ] Manually trigger `/api/cron/process-subscriptions` (with auth header)
- [ ] Subscription billing processes successfully
- [ ] Order created for fulfillment
- [ ] Inventory deducted
- [ ] Invoice marked as paid
- [ ] Receipt email sent

**Failed Payments:**
- [ ] Use a card that will decline (see Authorize.net test cards)
- [ ] Invoice created but marked as failed
- [ ] Subscription set to past_due
- [ ] Failed payment email sent
- [ ] Manually trigger `/api/cron/retry-failed-payments`
- [ ] Payment retried with proper backoff schedule

---

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation (Handled by API Routes)

**Important:** The `authorizenet-service.ts` library throws errors when credentials are missing. The graceful fallback logic is implemented in the **calling API routes**, not the service itself.

**API Route Behavior:**
- **One-time orders** (`/api/checkout/create-order`):
  - Checks `isAuthorizeNetConfigured()` before calling service
  - If not configured: Simulates successful payment with `TEMP-${Date.now()}` transaction ID
  - Development-only fallback for testing

- **Subscriptions** (`/api/checkout/create-subscription`):
  - **New card flow**: Checks `isAuthorizeNetConfigured()` before creating payment profile
    - If not configured: Returns 503 error with message "Payment processing not configured"
    - Subscriptions REQUIRE Authorize.net for card tokenization
  - **Saved card flow**: Uses existing payment method from database
    - Calls `chargeStoredPaymentMethod()` which throws if credentials missing
    - Error bubbles up and returns 402 error with payment failure message
    - No graceful fallback for saved card payments

- **Cron jobs** (`process-subscriptions`, `retry-failed-payments`):
  - Check credentials in `chargePaymentMethod()` function
  - If not configured: Simulate payment with `SIM-${Date.now()}` or `RETRY-${Date.now()}`
  - Log warning about missing credentials

### Error Codes
- `400` - Missing required fields
- `402` - Payment processing failed
- `404` - Customer or payment method not found
- `500` - Internal server error (database, Authorize.net API)
- `503` - Payment processing not configured (subscriptions only)

### Error Messages
All errors return JSON with `error` field:
```json
{
  "error": "Payment method not configured for Authorize.net CIM"
}
```

## Security Considerations

### ✅ What We Did Right

1. **No Card Data Storage:** Card numbers are never stored in our database. Only CIM profile IDs and last 4 digits.

2. **Tokenization:** All cards are tokenized through Authorize.net CIM before charging.

3. **Server-Side Processing:** All payment processing happens server-side, never client-side.

4. **Environment Variables:** API credentials stored in encrypted environment variables, not in code.

5. **Error Handling:** Payment errors don't expose sensitive information to clients.

### ⚠️ What to Add Later

1. **Accept.js Integration:** For PCI compliance, use Authorize.net Accept.js on frontend to tokenize cards before sending to backend. This prevents card data from ever touching your server.

2. **Fraud Detection:** Implement Authorize.net Fraud Detection Suite.

3. **3D Secure:** Add 3D Secure authentication for international cards.

4. **Webhook Verification:** Verify Authorize.net webhook signatures.

5. **Rate Limiting:** Add rate limiting to payment endpoints to prevent abuse.

---

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
1. **Accept.js Frontend Integration:** Replace manual card entry with Accept.js tokenization
2. **Refund System:** Implement refund processing via Authorize.net API
3. **Payment Method Management:** Allow customers to update/delete saved cards

### Medium Priority
4. **Failed Payment Recovery:** Automated dunning emails for past-due subscriptions
5. **Payment Analytics:** Dashboard showing payment success/failure rates
6. **Transaction History:** Customer-facing transaction history page

### Low Priority
7. **Alternative Payment Methods:** PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay
8. **Invoice Generation:** PDF invoice generation and download
9. **Payment Plans:** Split payments over multiple billing cycles

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Authorize.net credentials not configured"
**Solution:** Add `AUTHORIZENET_API_LOGIN_ID` and `AUTHORIZENET_TRANSACTION_KEY` to environment variables.

### Issue: "Payment method not configured for Authorize.net CIM"
**Cause:** Payment method in database doesn't have `authorize_net_profile_id` or `authorize_net_payment_profile_id`.
**Solution:** This happens with old payment methods. User needs to add a new card.

### Issue: "Failed to create customer profile: Duplicate record"
**Cause:** Authorize.net already has a profile for this customer ID.
**Solution:** Code handles this automatically by extracting existing profile ID from error message. If still failing, check Authorize.net dashboard for duplicate entries.

### Issue: Payment succeeds but order not created
**Cause:** Database error after payment processing.
**Solution:** Check application logs. The transaction ID is logged, so the payment can be tracked in Authorize.net. You may need to manually create the order record or refund the transaction.

### Issue: Subscription renewal fails with "Payment method not found"
**Cause:** Payment method was deleted from database but subscription still references it.
**Solution:** Update subscription with new payment method or cancel subscription.
