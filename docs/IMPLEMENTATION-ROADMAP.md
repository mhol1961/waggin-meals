**Current Status:** 33% feature complete (28/120 core features)
**Target:** 90%+ feature parity with Shopify/Square

3. **No tax calculation** - Legal compliance issue
4. **No inventory tracking** - Can't manage stock

### 🟡 Major Gaps (Needed Soon):
5. No subscription management portal
6. No shipping calculator
7. No analytics/reporting
8. No returns workflow

## 🎯 What to Build FIRST

Based on this analysis, here's the corrected priority order:

### Option A: RECOMMENDED PATH 🏆
**Build in this exact order:**

1. **Authorize.net Payment Integration** (Week 1) ⚡
   - NOTHING works without this
   - 12-16 hours
   - Blocking all other features

2. **Product Variants** (Week 2) ⚡
   - Critical for Christie's business model
   - 10-14 hours
   - Needed before any sales

3. **Tax Calculation** (Week 3) ⚡
   - Legal compliance requirement
   - 6-8 hours
   - Needed before launch

4. **Inventory Tracking** (Week 3-4) ⚡
   - Prevent overselling
   - 8-10 hours
   - Needed before launch

**After these 4 are complete: Soft launch possible! 🎉**

Then continue with Phase 2 (Subscriptions)...

---

### Option B: If You Don't Have Authorize.net Credentials Yet
**Build non-payment features while waiting:**

1. **Product Variants** (can build without payment)
2. **Inventory Tracking** (can build without payment)
3. **Tax Calculation** (can build without payment)
4. **Analytics Dashboard** (uses existing data)
5. **Product Search & Filters** (improves UX)

Then integrate Authorize.net when credentials arrive.

## 💰 Cost Considerations

| Service | Monthly Cost | Required? | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Supabase** | $0-25 | Yes | Free tier likely sufficient initially |
| **Authorize.net** | Already paying | Yes | Required for payments |
| **GoHighLevel** | Already paying | Yes | Already integrated |
| **Netlify** | $0-19 | Yes | Free tier works, Pro for better performance |
| **TaxJar** | $19 | Optional | Automatic tax compliance (Phase 3) |
| **ShipStation** | $10 | Optional | Automated shipping labels (Phase 3) |
| **Total Additional** | **$0-73/month** | | Can start with $0/month! |

**Compared to Shopify:**
- Shopify + Apps: $80-130/month
- **Your savings: $80-130/month = $960-1,560/year**

---

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

**Immediate Next Step:**
Start with **Authorize.net Payment Integration** (unless credentials not yet available).

**Questions to Answer:**
1. ✅ Do we have Authorize.net API credentials?
   - If yes → Start payment integration immediately
   - If no → Build non-payment features while waiting

2. ✅ What's Christie's timeline pressure?
   - Urgent → Focus only on Phase 1 (launch ASAP)
   - Flexible → Build in order, take time for quality

3. ✅ Can Christie test as we build?
   - Yes → Deploy to staging environment after each feature
   - No → Build full phase before testing
