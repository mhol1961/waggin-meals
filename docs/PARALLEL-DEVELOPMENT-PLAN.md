# Parallel Development Plan
## Payment Integration + Product Variants

**Date:** January 30, 2025
**Strategy:** Two development tracks running simultaneously

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Strategy

### **Track 1: Payment Integration (Main Agent)**
**Owner:** Primary Claude instance
**Timeline:** 12-16 hours
**Files:** Payment-related only

### **Track 2: Product Variants (Sub-Agent)**
**Owner:** Specialized agent
**Timeline:** 10-14 hours
**Files:** Variant-related only

### **Why This Works:**
- âœ… Minimal file overlap (different database tables, different components)
- âœ… Can be developed independently
- âœ… Both integrate at checkout (natural merge point)
- âœ… Both ready for testing at same time

### Shared Files (Coordinate Changes)
```
contexts/
  â””â”€â”€ cart-context.tsx (BOTH MODIFY)
      - Track 1: Add payment state
      - Track 2: Add variant_id to cart items

app/checkout/page.tsx (BOTH MODIFY)
  - Track 1: Add payment form
  - Track 2: Display variant info

types/
  â””â”€â”€ cart.ts (BOTH MODIFY)
      - Track 1: Add payment info
      - Track 2: Add variant_id to CartItem
```

---

## ðŸ”„ Integration Points

### Point 1: Cart Context
**Merge Strategy:** Sequential updates
1. Track 2 updates first (add variant_id)
2. Track 1 updates second (add payment state)
3. No conflicts (different properties)

### Point 2: Checkout Page
**Merge Strategy:** Section-based
1. Track 2: Adds variant display in order summary
2. Track 1: Adds payment form after shipping
3. Clear separation (different page sections)

### Point 3: Order Creation
**Both tracks modify:** `app/api/orders/route.ts`
**Merge Strategy:**
1. Track 2: Adds variant_id to order_items
2. Track 1: Adds payment validation before order creation
3. Can merge cleanly (different parts of order flow)

## ðŸ”§ Coordination Protocol

### Daily Sync Points:
1. **Morning:** Review completed work, identify conflicts
2. **Midday:** Check shared file status
3. **Evening:** Merge completed features, test integration

### Conflict Resolution:
1. **Minor conflicts:** Main agent resolves
2. **Major conflicts:** Redesign affected section
3. **Blocking issues:** Pause one track temporarily

### Communication:
- Sub-agent reports progress via return message
- Main agent reviews and provides feedback
- Both tracks documented in git commits

---

## âœ… Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (During Development):
- Track 1: Test payment tokenization
- Track 2: Test variant CRUD operations

### Integration Testing (After Both Complete):
1. Add variant product to cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Enter payment information
4. Complete order
5. Verify:
   - Payment processed correctly
   - Variant details saved to order
   - Inventory decremented
   - Confirmation email sent

### Edge Cases:
- Payment fails â†’ order not created
- Variant out of stock â†’ cannot checkout
- Price changes â†’ update cart before checkout
- Multiple variants in single order

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready to Launch!

Both agents will start simultaneously. Main agent (payment) will coordinate merge and integration.

**Let's build! ðŸš€**
