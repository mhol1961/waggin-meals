# GoHighLevel Snapshot Setup Guide
## Subscription Billing Automation Workflows

This document provides all the information needed to create GoHighLevel workflows for the Waggin Meals subscription billing system.

---

## Overview

The Waggin Meals website sends webhook events to GoHighLevel for all subscription-related events. GHL workflows receive these events and handle all customer communication (emails, SMS, etc.).

**Architecture:**
- **Supabase** ‚Üí Processes payments, manages subscriptions, stores data
- **Webhook** ‚Üí Sends event to GHL when subscription events occur
- **GoHighLevel** ‚Üí Receives event, triggers workflow, sends email/SMS to customer

---

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# GoHighLevel Integration
GHL_WEBHOOK_URL=your_ghl_webhook_url_here
GHL_API_KEY=your_ghl_api_key_here  # Optional, only if GHL requires authentication
```

**How to get these:**
1. Log into your GoHighLevel account
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Create a new webhook endpoint for "Subscription Events"
4. Copy the webhook URL provided by GHL
5. Paste it into your `.env.local` file

---

## How to Create GHL Workflows

### Step 1: Create Webhook Trigger

In each workflow:
1. Add trigger: **Webhook**
2. Set filter: `event_type` equals `subscription.created` (or whichever event)
3. GHL will automatically parse the JSON data into custom fields

### Step 2: Add Email Action

For each event, create an email with dynamic fields:

**Available merge fields from webhook:**
- `{{customer.first_name}}`
- `{{customer.email}}`
- `{{customer.last_name}}`
- `{{customer.phone}}`
- `{{subscription.id}}`
- `{{subscription.frequency}}`
- `{{subscription.amount}}`
- `{{subscription.next_billing_date}}`
- `{{subscription.items[0].product_name}}`
- `{{subscription.items[0].variant_title}}`
- `{{subscription.items[0].quantity}}`
- `{{payment.invoice_number}}` (payment events only)
- `{{payment.transaction_id}}` (payment events only)
- `{{payment.attempt_count}}` (failed payment only)
- `{{payment.next_retry_date}}` (failed payment only)

### Step 3: Conditional Logic Examples

**For failed payments - escalate urgency:**
```
IF {{payment.attempt_count}} equals 1
  ‚Üí Send "Payment Issue - We'll Retry" email
ELSE IF {{payment.attempt_count}} equals 2
  ‚Üí Send "Important: Update Payment Method" email
ELSE IF {{payment.attempt_count}} equals 3
  ‚Üí Send "Final Notice: Subscription Will Be Paused" email
```

**For subscriptions by frequency:**
```
IF {{subscription.frequency}} equals "weekly"
  ‚Üí Send email mentioning weekly deliveries
ELSE IF {{subscription.frequency}} equals "monthly"
  ‚Üí Send email mentioning monthly deliveries
```

## Prompt for Your AI Assistant

**Copy and paste this to your GHL AI assistant:**

```
I need help creating 6 GoHighLevel workflows for subscription billing automation.

The workflows receive webhook events from my website with JSON data containing customer and subscription information.

Please create these 6 workflows:

1. subscription.created - Welcome email when subscription is created
2. subscription.payment.success - Payment confirmation
3. subscription.payment.failed - Alert customer to update payment (with conditional logic for 3 attempts)
4. subscription.paused - Confirmation when customer pauses
5. subscription.resumed - Welcome back when customer resumes
6. subscription.cancelled - Goodbye and feedback request

For each workflow:
- Set up webhook trigger filtering by event_type
- Create professional email template using merge fields from webhook data
- Add appropriate tags and contact updates
- Include follow-up sequences where relevant

Use these merge fields:
- {{customer.first_name}}
- {{customer.email}}
- {{subscription.amount}}
- {{subscription.next_billing_date}}
- {{subscription.frequency}}
- {{payment.invoice_number}}
- {{payment.attempt_count}} (failed payments only)
- {{payment.next_retry_date}} (failed payments only)

Brand: Waggin' Meals - Premium dog nutrition subscription
Tone: Friendly, professional, dog-lover focused
```

Then attach this file (GHL-SNAPSHOT-SETUP.md) so your AI has all the webhook event structures and examples.

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Test Webhook Connection

```bash
# Send test webhook to GHL
curl -X POST YOUR_GHL_WEBHOOK_URL \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_type": "subscription.created",
    "customer": {
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "first_name": "Test",
      "last_name": "Customer"
    },
    "subscription": {
      "id": "test-123",
      "status": "active",
      "frequency": "monthly",
      "amount": 89.99,
      "next_billing_date": "2025-02-28",
      "items": [
        {
          "product_name": "Test Product",
          "quantity": 1,
          "price": 89.99
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

### 2. Check GHL Workflow Triggers

- Go to GHL ‚Üí Automation ‚Üí Workflows
- Find "Subscription Created" workflow
- Check "Recent Activity" to see if test webhook triggered
- Verify email was sent to test@example.com

### 3. Test All 6 Event Types

Send test webhooks for all 6 event types to ensure workflows trigger correctly.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to configure anything on the website?**
A: Just add `GHL_WEBHOOK_URL` to your `.env.local` file. The website handles the rest.

**Q: What if GHL is down when an event occurs?**
A: The webhook will fail gracefully and log the error. You can resend webhooks manually if needed.

**Q: Can I send SMS instead of emails?**
A: Yes! In GHL workflows, add SMS actions instead of or in addition to email actions.

**Q: How do I customize the email templates?**
A: Edit them directly in GoHighLevel's workflow builder using the visual email editor.

**Q: Can I add delays between emails?**
A: Yes! Use GHL's "Wait" action to add delays (e.g., "Wait 24 hours" before sending follow-up).

**Q: What happens if a customer has multiple subscriptions?**
A: Each subscription event is sent separately with its own `subscription.id`. You can use that ID to track which subscription triggered the workflow.
