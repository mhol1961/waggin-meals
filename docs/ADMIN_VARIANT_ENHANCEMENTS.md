## 🎯 Features Added

### Inventory Adjustment Interface

**User Experience:**
1. Click "Adjust Inventory" button to show form
2. Enter quantity change (e.g., +50 for restock, -3 for damaged)
3. Select reason from dropdown
4. Add optional notes
5. Submit - inventory updates instantly with audit trail

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Full audit trail of every inventory change
- ✅ Prevents manual quantity editing errors
- ✅ Tracks who made changes and why
- ✅ Historical record for accountability
- ✅ Automatic inventory level updates

**Reasons Available:**
- **Restock**: Adding new inventory
- **Correction**: Fixing inventory errors
- **Damaged/Lost**: Removing damaged or lost units
- **Customer Return**: Adding returned items back
- **Other**: Custom adjustments

### Adjustment History Display

**Shows:**
- Date of adjustment
- Quantity changed (color-coded)
- Reason for change
- Notes about the adjustment
- Who made the adjustment

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Quick visibility into inventory changes
- ✅ Identify patterns (e.g., frequent damages)
- ✅ Audit compliance
- ✅ Troubleshooting inventory discrepancies

### Delete Variant Feature

**Functionality:**
- Red "Delete Variant" button at bottom left of form
- Browser confirmation dialog
- Automatic redirect to variants list after deletion
- Uses existing DELETE endpoint at `/api/variants/[id]`

**Safety:**
- Foreign key on `order_items.variant_id` is ON DELETE SET NULL
- Deleting a variant doesn't break existing orders
- Order items retain `variant_title` even after deletion

## 🔄 How It Works

### Inventory Adjustment Flow

```typescript
1. User enters adjustment details in form
2. Frontend calls POST /api/variants/[id]/adjust-inventory
3. API validates input and reason
4. API calls adjust_variant_inventory() RPC function
5. Database:
   - Updates variant.inventory_quantity
   - Creates inventory_adjustments record
   - Returns new variant data
6. Frontend refreshes variant and history
7. User sees updated inventory and new history entry
```

### Database Integration

**Uses Existing Function:**
```sql
adjust_variant_inventory(
  p_variant_id UUID,
  p_quantity_change INTEGER,
  p_reason TEXT,
  p_notes TEXT,
  p_order_id UUID,
  p_adjusted_by TEXT
)
```

**Creates Audit Record In:**
- `inventory_adjustments` table
- Fields: variant_id, quantity_change, reason, notes, order_id, adjusted_by, created_at

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements

### Design Decisions

**Feedback:**
- Browser alerts for success/error (TODO: Replace with toast notifications)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Potential Improvements
1. **Bulk Adjustments**: Adjust multiple variants at once
2. **Scheduled Adjustments**: Set future inventory changes
3. **Low Stock Alerts**: Automatic notifications when quantity drops
4. **Import/Export**: CSV upload for bulk adjustments
5. **Advanced Filters**: Filter adjustment history by reason, date range
6. **Charts**: Visual inventory trends over time
7. **Permissions**: Role-based access for adjustments

### Nice-to-Have Features

## 📊 Database Schema

### inventory_adjustments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE inventory_adjustments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  variant_id UUID REFERENCES product_variants(id),
  quantity_change INTEGER NOT NULL,
  reason TEXT NOT NULL,
  notes TEXT,
  order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id),
  adjusted_by TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Integration Points
- **Product Variants**: Links to `product_variants.id`
- **Orders**: Can link to `orders.id` for sale adjustments
- **Subscription Orders**: Links when subscriptions renew
