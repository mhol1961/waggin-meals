# Product Variants - Checkout & Orders Integration Complete

**Date:** January 28, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Database Migration
**Priority:** Launch-Critical

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

### 1. Database Migration File Created
**File:** `/supabase/migrations/add-variant-id-to-order-items.sql`

Adds:
- `variant_id UUID` column to `order_items` table
- Foreign key reference to `product_variants(id)` with ON DELETE SET NULL
- Performance index on `variant_id`
- Documentation comment

### 2. Order Creation Updated
**File:** `/app/api/orders/route.ts`

**Changes Made:**
- Lines 148-149: Order items now include `variant_id` and `variant_title` from cart
- Line 179: Email confirmations include variant_title
- Lines 165-181: Inventory deduction handles variants with `adjust_variant_inventory` RPC

**Flow:**
1. Cart items with variants include: `{ variant_id, variant_title, sku, price }`
2. Order items created with variant references
3. Variant inventory deducted using database function
4. Email confirmations show variant details

### 3. Subscription Billing Updated
**Files:**
- `/app/api/cron/process-subscriptions/route.ts` (lines 472-473)
- `/app/api/cron/retry-failed-payments/route.ts` (lines 447-448)

**Changes Made:**
- Subscription order items now include `variant_id` and `variant_title`
- Orders created from subscriptions properly track variant selections
- Inventory deducted from correct variant when subscription renews

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to SQL Editor
4. Copy contents of `/supabase/migrations/add-variant-id-to-order-items.sql`
5. Paste and run the migration
6. Verify success: `SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'order_items' AND column_name = 'variant_id';`

**Option B: Supabase CLI**
```bash
supabase db push
```

**Expected Result:**
- New column `variant_id` added to `order_items` table
- Index created on `variant_id`
- No data loss (existing orders have NULL variant_id, which is correct)

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Code

**Deploy to Production:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add variant support to checkout and order creation"
git push origin main
```

**Vercel/Netlify will automatically deploy.**

### Step 3: Verify Integration

**Test Checkout Flow:**
1. Visit a product with variants (must have `hasVariants: true` and an `id`)
2. Select a variant
3. Add to cart
4. Complete checkout
5. Check order in admin panel - should show variant_title
6. Verify inventory was deducted from correct variant

**Check Database:**
```sql
-- View recent orders with variants
SELECT
  o.order_number,
  oi.product_title,
  oi.variant_title,
  oi.variant_id,
  v.sku,
  v.inventory_quantity
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
LEFT JOIN product_variants v ON oi.variant_id = v.id
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üìã What Still Works

### Backwards Compatibility
- **Products without variants:** Still work exactly as before
- **Existing orders:** Unaffected (variant_id is NULL, which is valid)
- **Legacy cart items:** Items without variant_id create orders normally

### Graceful Fallbacks
- If cart item has no `variant_id`: Uses product-level inventory
- If variant doesn't exist: Foreign key is NULL (no error)
- Email confirmations: Shows variant_title only if present

## üîç Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required

**Variant Products:**
- [ ] Can select variant on product page
- [ ] Variant price displays correctly
- [ ] Variant stock status updates
- [ ] Add to cart works with variant selected
- [ ] Cart shows variant title (e.g., "Chicken Meal - 5lb")
- [ ] Checkout displays variant info
- [ ] Order confirmation email shows variant
- [ ] Admin order view shows variant_title
- [ ] Variant inventory decremented after purchase

**Non-Variant Products:**
- [ ] Add to cart works without variant selection
- [ ] Checkout completes normally
- [ ] Product inventory decremented

**Subscription Renewals:**
- [ ] Subscription order items include variant_id
- [ ] Variant inventory deducted on renewal
- [ ] Receipt email shows variant details

## üéØ Integration Points

### Cart Context (`/contexts/cart-context.tsx`)
‚úÖ Already supports variants with these fields:
- `variant_id`: UUID reference
- `variant_title`: Display name
- `sku`: Variant SKU
- Cart key: `${product_id}-${variant_id}` (treats variants as separate items)

### Product Page (`/app/products/[handle]/page.tsx`)
‚úÖ Fully integrated:
- Fetches variants from API
- Displays VariantSelector component
- Updates price based on selection
- Shows variant-specific stock status
- Passes selectedVariant to AddToCartButton
- Disables "Add to Cart" until variant selected

### AddToCartButton (`/components/add-to-cart-button.tsx`)
‚úÖ Variant-aware:
- Accepts optional `selectedVariant` prop
- Includes variant data in cart item
- Can be disabled when variant required but not selected

### Order Creation API (`/app/api/orders/route.ts`)
‚úÖ Variant-ready:
- Extracts variant_id and variant_title from cart items
- Creates order_items with variant references
- Deducts inventory from variant or product based on presence of variant_id
- Includes variant info in email confirmations

### Subscription Cron Jobs
‚úÖ Variant-compatible:
- Process-subscriptions cron includes variant_id
- Retry-failed-payments cron includes variant_id
- Both create orders with proper variant tracking

## üìä Database Schema

### order_items Table (After Migration)
```sql
CREATE TABLE order_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id),
  product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
  product_handle TEXT NOT NULL,
  product_title TEXT NOT NULL,
  variant_id UUID REFERENCES product_variants(id), -- NEW
  variant_title TEXT,
  quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  total DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- NEW INDEX
CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_variant_id ON order_items(variant_id);
```

### Inventory Deduction Flow
```typescript
if (item.variant_id) {
  // Deduct from variant inventory
  await supabase.rpc('adjust_variant_inventory', {
    p_variant_id: item.variant_id,
    p_quantity_change: -item.quantity,
    p_reason: 'sale',
    p_order_id: order.id,
    p_adjusted_by: 'system'
  });
} else {
  // Deduct from product-level inventory
  await supabase.rpc('decrement_product_inventory', {
    product_id: item.id,
    quantity: item.quantity,
  });
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Rollback

### Migration is Safe
- Adds column without modifying existing data
- NULL values allowed (backwards compatible)
- Foreign key with ON DELETE SET NULL (won't break if variant deleted)
- No downtime required

### Rollback Plan (If Needed)
```sql
-- Remove index
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_order_items_variant_id;

-- Remove column
ALTER TABLE order_items DROP COLUMN variant_id;

-- Redeploy previous code version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
1. **Checkout Display:** Checkout page may not yet show variant titles prominently (next task)
2. **Admin Order View:** Variant data present but UI may need enhancement
3. **Order Exports:** May need updates to include variant columns
4. **Packing Slips:** Variant SKU not yet on printable packing slips

### Non-Issues
- ‚úÖ Cart properly stores variants
- ‚úÖ Orders properly record variants
- ‚úÖ Inventory properly deducted
- ‚úÖ Emails include variant info
- ‚úÖ Subscriptions handle variants

## üí° FAQ

**Q: What happens to existing orders without variant_id?**
A: They remain unchanged with variant_id as NULL. The system treats NULL as "no variant" which is correct for legacy orders.

**Q: Can I mix products with and without variants in one order?**
A: Yes! The system handles both seamlessly. Items with variant_id use variant inventory, items without use product inventory.

**Q: What if I delete a variant that has associated orders?**
A: The foreign key is ON DELETE SET NULL, so the variant_id becomes NULL but the order remains intact with the variant_title preserved.

**Q: How do subscriptions know which variant to bill?**
A: Subscription items include variant_id in the items JSONB field. When billing, the system creates order items with that variant_id.

**Q: Will this affect Shopify export data?**
A: No. Shopify is being phased out. This is the new permanent system.
