## Current Problem - Shipping Cost Analysis

### The Issue
**Example**: $14.99 Treat Bag + $19.99 Shipping = **Customer pays 133% more for shipping than product**

This is killing conversions. Customers abandon cart when they see shipping costs.

### Root Cause
- Current system uses one-size-fits-all shipping
- Not optimized for product weight variations
- No zone-based pricing
- Light products subsidize heavy products (backwards!)

---

## Solution: Hybrid Shipping Strategy

### How It Works
**Small/Light Items** (Treat bags, supplements, toppers)
- Flat rate: $9.99 nationwide
- Products under 2 lbs

**Medium Items** (Small meal packs, combinations)
- Flat rate: $12.99 nationwide
- Products 2-5 lbs

**Large/Heavy Items** (Bulk meals, subscription boxes)
- Zone-based pricing: $9.99 - $17.99 based on distance from Asheville
- Products over 5 lbs
- Zones:
  - Zone 1 (Southeast): $9.99
  - Zone 2 (Mid-Atlantic/Midwest): $12.99
  - Zone 3 (Northeast/Plains): $14.99
  - Zone 4 (West): $17.99
  - Zone 5 (AK/HI): $29.99

**Local Pickup** (Asheville area)
- FREE - Always available

**Free Shipping Threshold**
- Orders $165+ ship FREE (keeping current threshold)

### Customer Impact Examples
**Before (Current)**:
- 1 Treat Bag ($14.99) + Shipping ($19.99) = $34.98 total
- Customer: "This is ridiculous!"

**After (Hybrid)**:
- 1 Treat Bag ($14.99) + Shipping ($9.99) = $24.98 total
- Customer: "That's reasonable!"
- **Result**: 50% reduction in shipping cost, massive conversion boost

## Data We Need from Christie

### 1. Product Weight Classification
We need to categorize each product:
- **Small** (< 2 lbs): Treat bags, supplements, single toppers
- **Medium** (2-5 lbs): Small meal packs, combo packs
- **Large** (5-50 lbs): Bulk meals, subscription boxes

**Action**: Go through product catalog and assign weight categories

### 2. Actual Shipping Costs
What do you actually pay to ship:
- A 1 lb package to California?
- A 5 lb package to Florida?
- A 20 lb subscription box to New York?

This helps us validate our pricing is profitable.

### 3. Shopify Shipping Reports (If Available)
- Average order weight
- Most common destinations
- Current shipping revenue vs costs
- Conversion rate drop at checkout

### Current State (Estimated)
- Monthly revenue: $3,000-5,000
- Shopify costs: $100-500/month + 2.9% fees

- Cart abandonment: ~70-80% (industry high)

### After Implementation (Conservative Estimates)
**Conversion Rate Improvement**: 1-2% ‚Üí 3-4% (2x improvement)

- After: $6,000-10,000/month (2x from conversion improvement alone)
- Recovered carts: +$500-1,000/month additional

**Cost Savings**:
- Eliminate Shopify: Save $100-500/month

- **Annual savings**: $660-4,620+
