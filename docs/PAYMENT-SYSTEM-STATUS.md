## üö® CRITICAL: Migration Required

**Before the payment system can work, you MUST:**

1. **Apply Database Migration:**
   ```sql
   -- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
   -- File: supabase/migrations/20250130_create_payments.sql
   ```

   **Steps:**
   - Open Supabase dashboard
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Copy/paste the migration file
   - Click "Run"
   - Verify: "Payment system tables created successfully!"

2. **Verify Tables Created:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'public'
   AND table_name IN ('payments', 'transactions', 'customer_payment_profiles');
   ```

   Should return 3 rows.

## üí≥ How Payment Processing Works

### Customer Flow:

```
1. Customer adds products to cart
   ‚Üì
2. Goes to checkout
   ‚Üì
3. Enters shipping information
   ‚Üì
4. **Enters payment information** (NEW)
   - Card number
   - Expiration date
   - CVV
   ‚Üì
5. Clicks "Place Order"
   ‚Üì
6. Accept.js tokenizes card (client-side, PCI-compliant)
   ‚Üì
7. Token sent to /api/payments
   ‚Üì
8. Server calls Authorize.net API
   ‚Üì
9. If approved:
   - Payment record created
   - Order created with status "processing"
   - Confirmation email sent
   - Customer sees confirmation page

   If declined:
   - Error shown to customer
   - No order created
   - No charge made
   - Customer can try different card
```

### Data Flow:

```
Payment Form (client)
  ‚Üì Card details
Accept.js (Authorize.net)
  ‚Üì Payment token (encrypted)
/api/payments (server)
  ‚Üì Transaction request
lib/authorize-net.ts
  ‚Üì API call
Authorize.net API
  ‚Üì Response (approved/declined)
Database (Supabase)
  ‚Üì Payment + Transaction records
Order created
  ‚Üì
Email sent (GHL)
  ‚Üì
Customer confirmation
```

### Security:

1. **Card numbers NEVER touch our server**
   - Accept.js tokenizes on client
   - Token sent to server
   - Server sends token to Authorize.net
   - Authorize.net processes real card

2. **Database stores minimal info:**
   - Last 4 digits only (for display)
   - Card type (Visa, MC, etc.)
   - No CVV, no expiration (except in CIM profiles)

3. **PCI Compliance:**
   - Using Accept.js = PCI SAQ-A compliance
   - Lowest compliance burden
   - No card data on our servers

## üéØ Testing Checklist

Before going live, test these scenarios:

### ‚úÖ Successful Payment:
- [ ] Small amount ($0.01) processes successfully
- [ ] Payment record created in database
- [ ] Transaction log created
- [ ] Order status updated to "processing"
- [ ] Confirmation email sent
- [ ] Customer sees confirmation page

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Declined Payment:
- [ ] Invalid card number shows error
- [ ] Expired card shows error
- [ ] Insufficient funds shows error
- [ ] Failed transaction logged
- [ ] No order created
- [ ] Customer can retry with different card

### üí∞ Refunds:
- [ ] Full refund processes successfully
- [ ] Partial refund processes successfully
- [ ] Cannot refund more than paid
- [ ] Refund transaction logged
- [ ] Payment status updated
- [ ] Order status updated if fully refunded
- [ ] Refund email sent to customer

### üîí Security:
- [ ] No full card numbers in database
- [ ] No card numbers in logs
- [ ] RLS policies prevent cross-customer access
- [ ] Accept.js loads correctly
- [ ] Payment form validates input

---

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Current Architecture:
- ‚úÖ Synchronous payment processing (3-5 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Single API call per transaction
- ‚úÖ Minimal database queries
- ‚úÖ No N+1 query issues

### Under Load:
- **100 concurrent checkouts:** Should handle fine
- **1,000 orders/day:** No issues expected
- **Payment processing time:** 3-5 seconds per transaction

### If Scaling Needed Later:
- Add payment queue for async processing
- Implement retry logic for failed API calls
- Add caching for payment status checks
- Consider webhook integration for status updates

---

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Authorize.net Fees (Production):
- **Per Transaction:** 2.9% + $0.30
- **Monthly Gateway:** $25/month
- **Example:** $100 order = $3.20 fee

### Comparison:
- **Shopify Payments:** 2.9% + $0.30 + $29/month platform
- **Your System:** 2.9% + $0.30 + $25/month gateway
- **Savings:** $4/month + no platform fee

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

### Minor Issues:
1. **No payment retry logic** - If API call fails (network issue), payment fails
   - **Fix:** Add retry with exponential backoff (future enhancement)

2. **No webhook integration** - Status updates are synchronous only
   - **Fix:** Add Authorize.net webhooks for settlement notifications (future)

3. **No fraud detection beyond AVS/CVV** - Basic fraud checks only
   - **Fix:** Add Authorize.net Advanced Fraud Detection Suite (optional upgrade)

### By Design:
1. **Production mode only** - Using live credentials
   - **Note:** Use small test amounts ($0.01) during development

2. **No Apple Pay / Google Pay yet** - Credit cards only
   - **Future:** Easy to add via Authorize.net Accept.js

3. **No recurring billing yet** - One-time payments only
   - **Next Phase:** CIM integration for subscriptions (Phase 2)

## üìù Notes for Christie

### Important Things to Know:

1. **You're using REAL credentials** - All transactions are live
2. **Test with small amounts** - Use $0.01 or $1.00 for testing
3. **Refunds take 3-5 business days** - Same as Shopify
4. **You can refund from admin panel** - No need to log into Authorize.net
5. **All payments logged** - Complete audit trail in database

### Customer Service FAQs:

**Q: Customer says card was declined**
- Check order in admin - was payment attempted?
- Common reasons: Insufficient funds, expired card, wrong CVV
- Have customer try different card or contact their bank

**Q: Need to refund an order**
- Go to admin ‚Üí orders ‚Üí [order] ‚Üí "Refund" button
- Enter amount (can do partial refunds)
- Refund processes immediately via Authorize.net
- Customer gets refund in 3-5 business days

**Q: Customer didn't receive confirmation email**
- Check spam folder first
- Check admin - was payment successful?
- Can resend from admin panel (future feature)
