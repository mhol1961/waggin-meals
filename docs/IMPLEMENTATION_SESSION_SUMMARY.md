## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Payment Processing
**Decision:** Use Authorize.net with CIM for tokenization
**Rationale:**
- Industry-standard payment gateway
- PCI DSS compliant
- Lower fees than Stripe for high volume
- Customer Information Manager for secure recurring billing
- Fallback to simulated payments in development

### 2. Shipping Calculator
**Decision:** Implement both zone-based and real-time rates
**Rationale:**
- Zone-based: No API costs, fast, predictable
- Real-time: Accurate carrier rates via Shippo when needed
- Automatic fallback ensures reliability
- Christie can choose based on business needs

### 3. Product Storage
**Decision:** Migrate from static data to database
**Rationale:**
- Dynamic inventory management
- Support for product variants
- Enable admin product management
- Prepare for future scale
- API-driven architecture

### 4. Customer Portal
**Decision:** Full self-service capabilities
**Rationale:**
- Reduce support burden on Christie
- Improve customer satisfaction
- Enable 24/7 account management
- Decrease cancellation rate through easy pause/skip
- Integrate with GHL for automated follow-up
